Halberds & Helmets
==================

This is the repository for my role-playing game house rules.
The German translation of these is
[Hellebarden und Helme](Hellebarden%20und%20Helme/).

I also have a very small number of adventures in the
[English section](Halberds%20and%20Helmets/).

The [Character Generator](https://github.com/kensanata/halberdsnhelmets/tree/master/Characters) for Hellebarden &
Helme, Basic D&D and Labyrinth Lord is currently
[installed on Campaign Wiki](http://campaignwiki.org/halberdsnhelmets).
