\section{Principles}

This book is for the \key{referee} of the game, the person that runs
everything that is not a player character.
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{No Skills}: This challenges players. They need to
  roleplay to be diplomatic, intimidating, bluffing, and the referee
  needs to roleplay the non-player characters accordingly. Players
  need to guess where hidden treasure and secret doors are and the
  referee has to provide the right amount of clues.

\item \textbf{Fewer Classes}: This provides less mechanical
  differentiation between characters. Players need to roleplay in
  order to differentiate characters.

\item \textbf{Quick Character Generation}: Easy character generation
  with few actual choices speeds things up. A high attrition rate is
  more acceptable as you can bring multiple characters to the table
  and make extras in a minute or two.

\item \textbf{Smaller Bonuses}: The smaller bonuses simplify the math
  and produce far less trickle down effects. This also makes the
  initial ability rolls less important (without actually resorting to
  point-buy).

\item \textbf{Random Character Generation}: Random character
  generation may surprise players and provide interesting party
  dynamics.

\item \textbf{Rare Healing}: Players need to avoid wandering monsters
  and avoid unnecessary fighting. This makes strategic decisions (when
  to fight) more important than tactical decisions (how to fight).

\item \textbf{Simple Combat}: No explicit rules for combat maneuvers
  and battle grids result in quicker combat rounds, less waiting for
  your turn, and more time to do other stuff---or more fights per
  session, if desired.

\item \textbf{Little Damage, Few Hit Points}: Fewer attacks and
  smaller damage bonuses simplify the math and speed things up.

\item \textbf{Treasure is Experience}: This encourages players to
  research their goals, picking their fights carefully. It also
  provides for an easy and quick reason for the party to form and go
  adventuring.

\item \textbf{No Buying or Selling of Magic Item }: Getting them
  should always involve adventuring.

\item \textbf{Random Encounters, Random Monsters}: This forces the
  referee to improvise and adapt the story on the fly.

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\textbf{Keep it short}: My main problem is that I don't want to spend
a lot of time in preparation for a session. Half an hour for a three
hour slot is all I'm prepared to invest.

\textbf{Campaign Map}: When I
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2011-01-13_Campaign_Start}{start a
  new campaign}, I create
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2009-12-02_Hexcrawl}{a small hex
  map}. You could use my
\href{https://campaignwiki.org/text-mapper}{random hexmap generator},
for example. I only start worrying about the ruins and lairs in the
various hexes once players actually explore the region. This is going
to be an
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2007-02-14_DM_Advice_–_Organic_Campaigns}{organic
  campaign}. I like to start with a wilderness surrounding a small
village. In the wilderness, travelling a hex takes a day. That keeps
things simple. See below for more on traveling. I work on the map,
adding more locations as players push forward.

\textbf{Use every idea} as soon as possible. Do not save good ideas
for later! Use them now. You will have more good ideas in the future.

\textbf{Settlements}: Every settlement has two or three interesting,
named people. These are the people of authority the characters are
likely to talk to. Every settlement should have a building or two
where you can find said named people, and an inn, or an exaplanation
for the missing inn. Don't bother with a map for the settlement.

\textbf{People}: Most of civilization consists of neutral, egoistical,
normal humans and appropriate demihumans from the monster manual.
Don't bother assigning levels unless these people are important.

\medskip
\index{Level!Others}
\begin{tabular}{cp{9cm}}
Level & Role \\
 0 & ordinary people \\
 1 & veterans, trained guards \\
 3 & a boss of one or two dozen people, captain of the watch, bandit boss \\
 5 & lord over a small settlement, a contested five mile hex, a tower, a small fortress, a sheriff, two of these might be the assistants of a level 9 lord \\
 7 & a captain of a small army, the most powerful chieftain of a tribe, a second in command to a level 9 lord \\
 9 & lord over a town, a castle plus a town or two, multiple villages, a region up to thirty miles in diameter, known up to a hundred miles away \\
 11 & great heroes, the favorites of the gods \\
 13 & prophets, avatars and holy men \\
 15 & demigods and immortals \\
 17 & god-like, granting wishes! \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\textbf{Names}: Keep lists of names to assign to non-player
characters. I like names to depend on gender and culture, so I usually
have multiple lists.

\textbf{News}: Spies and Sages allow you to feed setting information
to your players. Get into the habit of preparing a little something to
report for spies and sages in the employ of player characters.
Actionable information is preferred. Activities of rivals that can be
stopped. Rumors of treasures that can be sought. Let players know
where to go next if they want to pursue a certain goal.

\newpage

\textbf{Dungeons}: I like to prepare a number of small
dungeons\marginnote{If you need some inspiration, check out the
  \href{http://www.dungeoncontest.com/}{One Page Dungeon Contest}
  submissions. When the party explores one dungeon, use the time to
  make up some events surrounding the other dungeons. Giant frog
  plague? Cultists spreading? Rival party found some treasure?} and
place them on the campaign map. I make note of a few rumors that would
lead the party to the various dungeons and warnings they might hear in
order to prepare them for it. This is a sandbox campaign and the
encounters do not depend on the power level of the party. Instead, the
party gets to choose the risk they are willing to face by choosing
areas that are more or less dangerous based on the rumors they hear.

\textbf{Treasure}: I just roll for random treasure. Treasure spent
earns experience: 1 gp is worth 1 XP.\marginnote[-2em]{Expand on the
  list of \emph{buildings} and add cathedrals, tempels, hippodromes
  and the like as your players will need things to spend their gold
  on.}

\textbf{Magic Items}: I like magic weapons. If I roll up a simple +1
weapon I often pimp it with some extra gimmick.\marginnote{Talking,
  gnawing, cursing, trailing smoke, oozing strange liquids, …} Magic
items are not for sale. Potions can be bought from alchemists. Every
alchemist has a handful of potions they know how to make. They cost
around 500 gold.

\textbf{Stocking the dungeon}: Use a d20.\marginnote{This is easier
  than rolling two d6 which is what
  \href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2013-08-21_One_Roll_Dungeon_Stocking}{Moldvay
    uses}.}

\medskip
\index{Stocking}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
 d20 & Contents and Treasure \\
 1–5 & Empty \\
 6 & Unguarded treasure \\
 7 & Trap and unguarded treasure \\
 8–9 & Trap \\
 10–12 & Monster \\
 13–15 & Monster and treasure \\
 16–20 & Special \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\index{Random Encounters}\textbf{Random Wilderness Encounters}: Based on the current
area\marginnote{Keep using the same table while the player characters
  are in the same region: the same valley, the same forest, the same
  mountain range---basically a bunch of hexes that seem to belong
  together. } the party is in, jot down a little random encounter
table. Consider the critters in the surrounding dungeons, think of a
theme, browse the monster manuals and look at the pictures. If you
like beholders, maybe add a dwarf merchant with an extra eye stalk or
two to the encounter table. He's a spy for the beholder! If you like
frogs, go for an amphibian theme and pick psionic frog men, giant
frogs, toads, froglings, and so on. If you have a theme, consider
antagonists. Is the frog faction competing with the gnomes? Add a
gnome entry!

\medskip
\marginnote{Add one or more entries for \textbf{peaceful folk} from
  the neighborhood or named people from nearby settlements. Two of
  these is a good number. Add these at the top of the list. During the
  night, add this number as you roll. This is how you get slightly
  different results for day time and night time encounters. In this
  example, merchants and soldiers are only encountered during the day.
  At night, add +2 to your roll. Thus, psionic frog men and frog
  demons are only encountered during the night.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
d6 & Encounter \\
\sun~1 & merchants (1d6) \\
\sun~2 & soldiers  (1d6+3) \\
  3 & gnomes (1d6+2) \\
  4 & giant frogs (1d4) \\
  5 & froglings (2d6) \\
  6 & giant dragonfly \\
\rightmoon~7 & psionic frog men (2d6) \\
\rightmoon~8 & frog demons (1d4) \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\newpage

\key{Exploration}: Typically travel is initiated by a non-player
characters telling the player characters about a location. Usually
directions are accurate and the location and any landmarks on the way
get placed on the player map. When traveling, player characters cannot
get lost. A hex is usually big enough for multiple locations (a hill,
a lake, a castle, a village, a dungeon). Unknown locations are not be
easy to find. Use the typical \emph{search} abilities: 1/6 per day for
humans, 2/6 per day for demi-humans. Known locations can always be
found.

\key{Travel}: The default is one hex traveled per day unless there
are trails or roads (two per day; no bonus for riding or flying) or
they are traveling by ship along a coast (in which case it'll be eight
hexes per day). As it stands, this ignores movement speeds and hex
size. You travel one hex per day, that's it. I usually think that one
hex is five miles, but players don't need to know that.

Thus the actual \emph{procedure} at the gaming table is simple:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Players tell me where they want to go. There is a 1 in 6 chance
  for a daylight encounter and a 1 in 6 chance for a nighttime
  encounter for every hex traveled.
\end{enumerate}
\marginnote{That's it.}

\key{Lairs}: Many hexes have a building of some sort. I place stuff
I got from the net or from books I bought. I add lairs for all the
intelligent monsters on my encounter tables. As time passes, I might
add more locations and lairs to known hexes. It's simply not possible
to \emph{completely} map a hex.\marginnote{If you use five mile hexes,
  that's an area of about \unit[22]{mi²}.} There's always more stuff
to discover. Don't be afraid to add new stuff to existing hexes.

If you have some monsters on your random encounter table and haven't
decided where the lairs of these creatures are, there's a 1 in 6
chance when encountering them that you have found their lair. Let
players find the secret gnome village, the slaad temple, the frogling
pond. These improvised lairs will necessarily be simple one, two or
three room affairs. No problem.

\textbf{Monsters}: It's easier if monsters announce themselves: let
players find, smell or hear something.\marginnote{Use the
  \emph{reaction roll}. Not all encounters need to end in a fight. Use
  \emph{morale checks} ins combat. Not all fights are to the death.
  Here are some typical morale scores:

  \medskip
  \index{Morale!Others}
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2 & animals that will always run \\
    3 & animals when cornered \\
    4 & herbivores \\
    5 & carnivores and cowards \\
    6 & cautious people \\
    7 & normal men \\
    8 & well led humanoids \\
    9 & disciplined troops \\
    10 & fanatics \\
    11 & lunatics \\
    12 & unnatural creatures \\
  \end{tabular}} This allows them to choose
their approach. Determine encounters before the game starts or have a
procedure to determine the number of monsters encountered ready. Use
1d8 if you're at a loss. This makes sure that you're not scaling the
encounter to the players. Let the \emph{players decide} whether to
engage or not.

\textbf{Animals}: Remember that most animals don't want to fight.
That's why the list of monsters only include dangerous animals. That
doesn't mean deer and birds are not encountered. It just means that
those encounters usually aren't interesting enough to warrant a lot of
time at the table.

\textbf{Adapt the encounter} as it happens. If your players are bored,
let the monsters fight. If your players need guidance, have the
monsters talk. If your players are afraid, make it easy to avoid the
encounter. The entertainment of your friends at the table takes
priority. A \emph{total party kill} can be part of it. Know your
players.

\newpage

\textbf{Keep Adding}: In order add life to the world, you need to have two or
three events or changes happen between sessions if time passes
in-game. A lot of it should relate to what the party did. If their dog
was killed by a giant crab and they didn't rescue it, then there will
be a rumor of a ghost dog haunting the beaches. If they discovered
skeletons in a crypt and fled, they have released undead that will be
roaming the neighborhood. If they had hirelings with them, those will
be spreading rumors of a necromancer. Use these rumors to add big and
small adventure options for the players to focus on.

\textbf{Focus Follows Players}: As time passes, you should see a
constant trickle of little ideas to add to your campaign. Prepare for
3-7 of these potential adventures and keep a list of open plots to
remind players of ongoing issues. More adventures develop wherever the
party shows up. If the party fights a mammoth and decides to track it
back to the forest, then maybe there will be neanderthals living
there. If the players try to contact them, maybe there will be a
sabre-toothed cat and a velociraptor in the area. If they investigate
the velociraptor, they might find a valley full of dinosaurs.

Essentially players express their interest in the campaign by spending
time. If players never leave town, then they want urban adventures. If
they keep returning to your megadungeon, then that's what they want.
Giving players real options will make sure the game adapts to their
preferences (and yours, given that you are providing the options).

\key{Contacts}: Keep a list of contacts. These provide easy plot
hooks. Magic-users provide new spells in exchange for quests. Sages
provide information about items found in exchange for quests. Rulers
provide men-at-arms in exchange for quests. They can provide rumors
and gossip that hint at things to get involved in. Provide enough to
allow choice but not too much in order to save preparation time and
avoid decision paralysis. Keep it somewhere between three and seven. I
also like to play up alignment. A drug abusing alchemist hands out
chaotic quests, a curious insect trainer hands out lawful quests.

\textbf{Living World}: Keep a list of a handful in addition to your
list of contacts. Between sessions, check whether any of the entries
need to be removed or changed. Consider adding new entries. It's best
to do this soon after the session when recent events are still fresh.
Let your players know about these changes during the next session.
"You notice a new bard in the Yellow Straightjacket. She is called
Miela, newly arrived from Halgorn. Ilaria appears to have left for
Tlan."

\key{Maps}: Maps are inspiring. They provide a sense of place, every
landmark they contain is a potential exploration goal, yet another
option for players to pursue. Keep a campaign map, hand out treasure
maps, let other characters draw maps for the party.

Players need options, and maps are like option tokens. Maps are also
props that are very easy to make.

\textbf{Goals}: Talk to your players about their character goals every
now and then. Identify the players that have interesting goals you'd
like to pursue, and start providing rumors that lead to adventures on
the way to achieving those goals.

Two or three players pushing their own agendas can be a lot of fun.
There will be a little rivalry because each character needs to pursue
their own quests. There will be some cooperation: "I'll help you
retrieve ice from that glacier for your frost rapier if you will help
me find Xu-Li the fire sage."

Not everybody needs to have goals! You just need enough player goals
to add adventure seeds to your campaign. If all the players have
divergent goals, they end up not having a reason to adventure
together. In that case you might be better off adding a traditional
villain to the mix: A powerful nemesis that sends minions after the
characters, builds an army to attack their home base, coordinates the
bad guys in the region such that the party absolutely needs to fight.
Just increase the pressure whenever the players are starting to
squabble again.

\key{Spotlight}: I like to give enemies the opportunity to shine every
now and then. Don't overdo it. I find that providing a single
non-player character the opportunity to shine in a session is about
right.

The same is true for player characters. I'll try to emphasize
situations where a player character specifically did something
awesome. It lets players know that I appreciated their character being
there and the things they did. Everybody likes this.

If a player is very entertaining in the game, I like to encourage
them. Non-player characters will go along with a lot of silliness as
long as it doesn't strain my credulity.

Even quiet players like to shine. Sometimes you just have to guess
what makes them tick. Perhaps they'd like romantic success? As the
extroverts grab the spotlight, make sure to interrupt the action once
or twice per session and offer a scene to an introverted player. The
leader is charmed by their presence, the enemy wants to talk to nobody
else but them, the farmers ask them for advice. Don't overdo it.
Sometimes shy players don't want to make big decisions. A public
display of respect or admiration might be enough.

\key{Planning}: If players invest a lot of time into a particular
plan, I like to join in and provide advice---my commentary stands in
for their character's knowledge of the world.\marginnote{If you feel
  that they over-planned it, make sure you use words like "boring
  wait" and "endless hours pouring over your preparations" as you
  remind them of the time wasted in-game.} I also like to reward
players for the effort by having their plans succeed. Be sure to
recapitulate the successful execution of the plan, coloring it
appropriately. Avoid the evil feedback loop of foiling their
plans.\marginnote{Avoid boring "it doesn't work" results. Succeed or
  fail spectacularly.} They'll counter it by spending even more time
planning or by trying to keep you out of the planning phase. This
makes the session boring.

If players don't want to plan a lot, then that's even more awesome,
because it gives you the opportunity to improvise some action scene.
Roll for wandering monsters or the like and go for it.

\newpage

\key{Background}: I tend to prefer character accomplishments to
character abilities. Thus, player characters in my games are
mechanically simple. If a player wants to do something that I think is
out of the ordinary, I ask for an explanation: "Do you think your
character can do this?" If the player says yes, then we think of an
explanation and have the player write it down on the character sheet.
That's how we learn that the dwarf has in fact served as a scout and
an ensign in the dwarven army.

\key{Development}: Hopefully the events at the table shape the
characters. Was the character generous or avaricious? Was the
character diplomatic or rude? Was the character honest or deceitful?
That's what we need all the social encounters for. By interacting with
other characters, players can develop their own character. Therefore,
they need to meet people that can be cheated or dealt with honestly.
They need to meet people that can be robbed and people that beg. It
forces players to make choices regarding their characters. It's how
they grow to be more real.

Avoid situations where there is only one course of action. If you can
only rescue the baron's child, then there's no choice involved. You
should add temptation at every single step. Slavers will be interested
in the child. Enemies of the baron will be interested.

Sometimes there are no obvious choices, and none of the choices will
help define the character. The baron's child might not want to return
back home, preferring to go on adventure instead. The character's
choice will define what they see as filial duty and family integrity.
Hardly heroic decisions to be made! Use these situations rarely.

\textbf{Influence and Reputation}: Find a way to let characters gain
influence and a reputation through adventuring. This anchors them in
the campaign world and encourages character development instead of
character ability gain. It's a different sort of
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2009-11-24 Rewards}{reward}.

\textbf{Announce consequences} before players commit to
actions.\marginnote{The following list is from
  \href{https://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2011/09/on-ressurecting-quantum-ogre-and-having.html}{the
    Hack \& Slash blog}.} There can only be meaningful choice if
players know what to expect. ("If you fail the roll, you'll […]. Do
you want to risk it?")

\textbf{Provide information} if players are unsure. You can wrap it in
vague language, but be sure to provide the necessary information.
("It's hard to say, but you feel a nagging suspicion that he's
probably hiding something.")

In the same vein, \textbf{provide warnings} if players are putting
themselves in danger. You're aiming for "I knew it!" when something
bad befalls player characters. ("You notice that the hanging bridge
above the tar pits seems frail. Just make sure nobody cuts those
ropes!")

\textbf{Provide alternatives} if you think that what players want
should be impossible. ("You can't just buy a magic weapon but they say
there's a hidden entrance to a goblin market in the Smoke Forest.")

\textbf{Add obstacles} whenever players are getting what they want.
("The insect trainer will teach your lizard how to spy ahead if you
provide her with a living giant wasp.")

\end{quote}

\key{HD} are hit-dice; roll as many d8 to determine hit-points. A +1
or +2 means that the monster attacks as if it had a HD more, so it is
relatively ferocious.

\key{AC} is armor class and determines how hard it is to hit.

What follows are all the \emph{attacks} that require a to-hit roll.
Special abilities and spells are listed at the end.

\key{Saving Throw} is next, the letter indicating the class to use (F
stands for fighter and it's the default). The level is usually the
same as the number of hit dice. Animals usually save at half their hit
dice.

\key{MV} is the movement rate. Often a note is added to explain
unusual values, eg. MV 15 (fly).

\key{ML} is the morale score.

\key{Animals} fear fire and aren’t intelligent, even if trained. A
trained war dog, for example, will attack when commanded and it will
defend itself when attacked, but it will not defend others use
interesting tactics.

\key{Mounts} are creatures that can carry somebody on their back. A
mount takes a \emph{retainer} slot. Unlike ordinary retainers, mounts
will not gain levels and they are usually not intelligent. They prefer
not to fight and will only attack somebody that is attacking them in
melee. If their owner dies in combat, mounts are \emph{free} and will
try to flee. If anybody manages to take their rider's place, either by
killing them or otherwise dismounting them, they can \emph{take over}.
Anybody can jump onto a horse and ride it! Note: if a mount is also a
\emph{pet}, then their loyalty is not as easy to command.

\key{Pets} also takes a \emph{retainer slot}. Unlike ordinary
retainers, pets will not gain levels and they are usually not
intelligent. A pet is a \emph{friend}. Thus, they will attack anybody
attacking you in melee, but they won't take a blow for you, nor will
they get involved if you're not being attacked. If their owner dies in
combat, pets will go \emph{feral}. They defend their owner's corpse
against both friends and enemies until the fight is over. Then they
leave, if they can. Taking over a pet requires you to make them your
friend.

\key{Gems} are all sorts of previous stones. Their value is
determined using a table.\marginnote[-1em]{
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    1d20   & Value \\
    1--3   &  10 \\

\key{Jewelry} is rings, necklaces, bracelets, diadems, crowns,
scepters and the like. Each piece is worth 3d6×100
gold.\marginnote{Average value for each piece of jewelry: 1050 gold.}



\section{Ape, Giant}
\index{Ape}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Ape.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

The giant ape fur is usually white, brown or black. Some of the tribes
are more intelligent than others, mastering a language and the art of
hunting with spears. From such tribes, retainers and future player
characters can be recruited.

\begin{quote}
  HD 3 AC 7 1d6/1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 5 XP 50
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1d20. They live in jungles, some of them solitary,
others in larger tribes. Larger groups may live together with smaller
monkeys, but these never fight. They just make a lot of noise, if you
try to sneak up to the giant apes.

\textbf{Treasure}: When encountered in a ruined temple, they might
have collected some shiny stuff. 20\% for 1d4×1000 silver, 30\% for
1d6×1000 gold, 10\% for 1d6×100 platinum, 10\% for 1d6

they speak their own language (like the Wookie Chewbacca); they attack
like fighters; they use a d8 for their hit dice, like fighters; they
wear no armor and wield no melee weapons but they can throw bamboo
spears; they attack twice per round when punching stuff; they have a
natural armor class of 7; they can only use a limited set of magic
items: amulets, necklaces, ioun stones, earrings -- anything requiring
neither arms nor feet nor anything worn like clothes; minimum strength
is 9; maximum level is 8 because they are not very ambitious; ordinary
giant apes start at level 3 when hired as retainers.

\section{Basilisk}
\index{Basilisk}
\index{Cockatrice}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Basilisk.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

The basilisk is the "little king of serpents" -- it's a monstrous
snake ten paces long and nearly chest high at its thickest. The
basilisk's scales are usually green or brown, and upon it's head it
wears a crown of gold. It's lair is filled with toxic fumes, a deadly
poison to all. It's breath poisons the air for 30 ft. around it.
\textbf{When you breathe in these fumes}, save vs. poison or die. You
can hold your breath for one round and fight. If you keep fighting,
save vs. death or faint. Once you faint, your body will start
breathing again. At which point you'll need to save vs. poison or die.
It's gaze will also kill, such is the power of it's poisonous spirit.
\textbf{If it sees you}, and you did not have to save vs. poison this
round, do so now or die. And finally, if you manage to approach the
basilisk without being slain by it's stench or gaze, you still have to
survive it poisonous fangs. \textbf{If you are hit}, and you did not
have to save vs. poison this round, do so now or die.

\begin{quote}
  HD 6+1 AC 4 1d10 + \emph{poison} F6 MV 6 ML 9 XP 680
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1. The basilisk lives alone. The general area where
a basilisk rules might feature a lot of snakes, but none will approach
a basilisks lair and none will fight intruders. The basilisk hatches
from a cursed egg lain by a cock and is thus also known as a
cockatrice. It never mates.

\textbf{Treasures}: A basilisk's lair usually contains the remainders
of many a dead villager and soldier foolish enough to try and kill it.

\textbf{Terrain}: deserts, ruins.



\section{Bear}
\index{Bear}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Bear.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Bears may stand up in combat, attacking with both claws and a
bite---and \textbf{if both their claws hit}, the bear will
\textbf{hug} you for an additional 2d8 damage. When encountered in
their natural habitat, bears will usually ignore you unless you come
closer than 30 ft. or if they are hurt in any way.

\begin{quote}
  HD 4 AC 6 1d4/1d4/1d6 + \emph{hug} F2 MV 12 ML 5 XP 135
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1d4. They live as small families or they are angry,
male loners.

\textbf{Treasure}: none.

\textbf{Terrain}: forests, mountains.

\textbf{War Bears}: Trained bears are sometimes used by dwarves as
\textbf{pets}. These can wear a metal back plate and skull cap giving
them AC 4 instead of 6. A trained war bear will cost 500 gold and the
armor that goes along with it will cost you another 500 gold. They'll
only sell it to you if you are a \emph{dwarf friend}. You must have
performed some valuable service for the clan before they sell you
their precious war bears. War bears can be used as \textbf{mounts} by
small creatures (usually dwarves, elves and halflings).

\textbf{Larger} bears are possible. Usually these \emph{dire bears}
are the result of \emph{Ursomancy}---bear magic.

\section{Bee, Giant}
\index{Bee}
\index{Wasp}
\index{Ant}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Bee.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Giant bees are the result of earth magic leaking into the environment.
They are as big as cows, their wingspan is as wide as a house and when
they fly it sounds like war drums.

Don't be fooled by their name. These bees are omnivorous and kill
sheep and halflings for food. \textbf{When stung}, save vs. poison or
die. These stings are solid. The bee will not die after having stung
its victim.

Their nest is ruled by a \textbf{queen}. If she dies, the entire nest
will disperse and die sooner or later. The queen itself is huge,
practically immobile and does nothing but lay eggs. She does not
fight.

\begin{quote}
  HD 4+1 AC 5 1d6 + \emph{poison} MV 15 ML 9 XP 47
\end{quote}

\textbf{Number}: 1 scout, 2d4 feeding party (and their victim), or a
nest with 2d4×10 including a queen.

\textbf{Treasure}: \emph{gelée royale} (royal jelly) is what the bees
use to feed larvae destined to become new queens. It is said to be the
most potent cure for old age, wasting diseases and lack of virility.
That is why the jelly of one nest is worth 5000 gold to the old and
the dying.

\textbf{Terrain}: jungles, forests.

\textbf{Giant Wasps} and \textbf{Giant Ants} are just like giant bees,
except ants only fly when they are about to mate.

Certain savage tribes of lizard people have learned the pheromone
secrets allowing them to use giant wasps as \textbf{mounts}.



\section{Beetle, Giant}
\index{Beetle}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Beetle.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

These giant, horned and armored beetles are as big as a wagon. They
love the humid underground, always hungry for meat.

Giant beetles are sometimes used as \textbf{mounts} by those
underground creatures that know how direct them with magic glow
sticks. The key is to keep them well fed. This can be tricky on long
underground voyages.

\begin{quote}
  HD 4 AC 3 2d6 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 80
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1d6.

\textbf{Treasure}: none.

\textbf{Terrain}: caves.



\section{Boar}
\index{Boar}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Boar.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Wild pigs are dangerous and hard to kill for simple folks. Pigs are
said to very intelligent but nobody cares---except for orcs. Orcs keep
pigs as \textbf{pets} like humans keep dogs.

\begin{quote}
  HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 65
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1d4. Most of the time there will be only one or two
wild pigs, possibly with some young piglets which won't fight. If more
are encountered, these are mostly aggressive young males.

\textbf{Treasure}: none.

\textbf{Terrain}: forests, savanna.

\textbf{Giant Boars} do exist. They are bred as \textbf{mounts} by
dwarves and halflings.

\begin{quote}
  HD 5+1 AC 6 1d12 F2 MV 15 ML 9 XP 260

\section{Bugbear}
\index{Bugbear}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Bugbear.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Bugbears are lynx-people, often a bit taller than humans. They live in
the woods, naked and wild unless they have entered the service of a
dark elf queen in which case they're busy stealing you babies leaving
ugly psychopath changelings for you to raise instead---or spying for
the raiding party soon to follow.

They will \textbf{surprise} you on 1–5 in 6. This makes them natural
thieves and assassins in the service of dark elves.

\begin{quote}
  HD 3+1 AC 5 1d10 F3 MV 9 ML 9 XP 100
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1d12. Typically you will encounter small Commando or
scouts. Where they are found, their elven masters are not far behind.
If they are not in the service of anybody, they are elusive and hard
to find.

\textbf{Treasure}: If they carry any treasure then it is money earned
serving their elven masters. 20\% for 1d4×1000 silver, 30\% for
1d4×1000 gold, 30\% for 1d8
\href{https://campaignwiki.org/gems}{gems}, 20\% for 1d4

% 0.2*2.5*100 + 0.3*2.5*1000 + 0.3*4.5*176 + 0.2*2.5*1050

\textbf{Terrain}: forests, caves.


\section{Creeper}
\index{Creeper}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Creeper.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

This thing looks like a man-sized caterpillar with many smaller
tentacles around its mouth. It feeds on the dead or the nearly dead.
They will avoid opponents that look sharp and active. In the dark,
when you're out of your mind and sobbing in fear, they'll come for
you. \textbf{When touched by one of the tentacles}, save vs. paralysis
or be paralyzed for two hours. If left undisturbed, the creeper will
then proceed to eat you alive, while you're unable to move or scream.
While you're still moving, the creeper will not bite and thus no
damage is dealt.

\begin{quote}
  HD 2 AC 7 8×\emph{paralysis} F1 MV 6 ML 5 XP 38
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1d4.

\textbf{Treasure}: Sometimes you'll find the remains of a dead cave
explorer nearby. 10\% for 1d4×1000 silver, 20\% for 1d6×1000 gold,
10\% for 1d4×100 platinum, 20\% for 2d6

\textbf{Terrain}: caves.



\section{Cat, Large}
\index{Cat, Large}
\index{Panther}
\index{Lion}
\index{Tiger}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Cat.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Mountain lions, panthers, tigers -- these are large cats that will
sneak up on you and \textbf{surprise} you on 1--4 in 6. Cats can be
kept as \textbf{pets} but they have a mind of their own and while they
will follow you around, it's doubtful that they will attack your
enemies when you want it. They will go out to hunt for your enemies on
their own initiative, however. Elves favor large cats.

\begin{quote}
  Panther: HD 4 AC 6 1d4/1d4/1d8 F2 ML 8 MV 21 XP 135\\
  Lion: HD 5 AC 6 1d6/1d6/1d10 F3 ML 9 MV 15 XP 350\\
  Tiger: HD 6 AC 6 1d6/1d6/1d12 F3 ML 9 MV 15 XP 570
\end{quote}

\textbf{Numbers}: 1. Some large cats will hunt in larger groups. When
encountering a pride of lions, for example, use 1d12 instead.

\textbf{Treasure}: none.

\textbf{Terrain}: forest, jungle, savanna.
