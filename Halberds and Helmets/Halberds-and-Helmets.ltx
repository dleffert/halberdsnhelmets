\section{Old School}

\newthought{We play classic D\&D} using
\href{https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2012-02-18_Ode_to_Ode_to_Black_Dougal}{rules
  from the early eighties}. This is
\href{http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul}{not a
  Monty Haul campaign} and
\href{http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling}{not
  a stupid dungeon crawl}. If at all, we explore a nightmarish
\href{http://www.grey-elf.com/philotomy.pdf}{mythical underworld}.

\marginnote{Ownership of the rules is optional. We'll add more rules
  as time passes. Discovering and befriending intelligent humanoids,
  for example, will allow you hire them and eventually to play them.
  Certain magic users can teach player characters new spells, too.}

The rules offer \textbf{very little mechanics}: there aren't many
classes to choose from, no feats, no skills, no prestige classes and
hardly any special abilities. Furthermore, elves, dwarves and other
demihumans are simply separate classes. There are no elven thieves of
dwarven mages. On the other hand, missing rules also leave \textbf{a
  lot of freedom} for players. The characters are as diplomatic,
friendly or intimidating as the players want them to be. There are no
rules governing it.

\marginnote{Players determine where the campaign will head. If player
  characters investigate rumors and locations, I will develop the game
  world in that direction. The harder you look, the more there is to
  see.} We're playing in a
\href{http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox}{sandbox}.
There is \textbf{no planned ending} for the campaign. The actions of
player characters determines the directions the campaign grows in.

Dangers are not adapted to the strength of the party. Generally
speaking it's safer near civilized settlements. The further you move
into the wilderness, the more dangerous it is. That's how
\textbf{players control the risks they want to take}.

Preparation and experience should help you avoid situations, where
your character's survival depends on a single die roll. If you're
rolling dice, it's already too late. \textbf{A saving throw is your
  last chance} to survive due to luck and experience. Ideally you
would never have to roll dice because you're well informed and
equipment. Perseus didn't have to save against the medusa's petrifying
gaze because \emph{he was well prepared}.

\textbf{Retainers are another safeguard against character death}:
torch bearers, porters, men-at-arms and mercenaries all cost money,
but they will also keep your character alive. Should player characters
die, the next character is most probably going to be one of the
retainers.

\textbf{Experience points} are gained by \textbf{spending gold} you
gained on adventures. If you manage to obtain the gold without combat,
good for you. The best strategy is to pick your battles and stake the
odds in your favor as far as possible. Remember, if you're rolling
dice, it's already too late.

\marginnote{A short summary for players:
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item copy your saving throws for level 1
  \item roll for hit points
  \item choose alignment
  \item roll for money
  \item buy equipment

\key{Strength} allows you to carry more and to hit harder. Add the
bonus to your to-hit rolls and to your damage rolls when using
\emph{melee weapons}.

\key{Dexterity} allows you to aim better and to better avoid attacks.
Add the bonus to your to-hit roll when using \emph{ranged weapons}
(but not to your damage rolls) and subtract the bonus from your
\emph{armor class} (lower is better).

\key{Constitution} determines your health. Add the bonus to every
\emph{hit die} (but never reduce a hit die below 1).

\key{Intelligence} determines your education. If you have a positive
bonus, it indicates how many \emph{extra languages} you speak.

\key{Wisdom} determines how much in tune with the world you are. Add
the bonus to your \emph{saving throws against magic} (spells, wands
and the like).

\key{Charisma} determines how well others

The \key[Law]{Priests of Law} say: ``Alone we are weak and life is a
valley of tears. Together we are strong. Together we build our homes.
Together we till our fields. Together we defend our towns and
villages. Together are we strong.

We build dams against the flood. We build aqueducts against the
drought. We build canals against the plague. We drain the swamps and
push back the fever. We fill our granaries and defeat famine.

We punish treachery and reward loyalty. We ensure law and justice.
Even if the corruption of chaos and anarchy are on the rise, we have
our heavenly order from the highest gods in heaven down to the lowest
devils in hell. They make sure that punishment and rewards are not
forgotten—not now and not for all eternity.

In our world, everybody has a place and there is a place for
everybody—including you. See these books: the knowledge of the elders,
the scriptures and tablets of our ancestors. This is our inheritance.
Learn as much as you can, work as hard you can. Lift your head, rise!
Be a true member of our proud community.''

The \key[Chaos]{Priests of Chaos} say: ``Life is Chaos: the weeds in
the plowed fields, the orchards gone to woods, the shore worn away by
the sea. Chaos is long patterns: the rivers unfurl, the clouds move as
they will but each with their own way.

The Elves make homes in the trees, but not by killing them and cutting
them into sharp-edged planks then watching those rot and weather. No,
they watch for the trees' patterns and shape them slowly and live
among them; the tree living, the Elf living.

Order is the hubris that mans' whims can be imposed on the world, and
dooms them---man, woman, and child---to a lifetime of wearying burden.
Chaos is not the burning of cities, but realizing the foolishness of
building such at all. Chaos is not lawlessness, but realizing that
men, like trees, have their ways, and to lay laws upon them without
acknowledging this, is to cut them down and bury them in plank-sided
boxes. Come with me. I know not where I'm going, but we will learn
along the way. '' \marginnote{The Chaos Priest's statement was taken

\section{Basic Rules}
\label{sec:basicrules}

Some key terms, first.

\key{Player}: The people sitting at the table, you, me, our friends.

\key{Character}: The people we’re playing. My name is Alex and I live
in Zürich. My character is called Edrig and hails from Einaheim.

\key{Experience Points} (\key{xp}): Tricking and defeating oponents
grants experience points. Spending money nets you \emph{one experience
  point per gold piece spent}. Examples: donations to a temple,
erecting a statue, organizing a party, building a manor house, hiring
servants, and so on. With enough experience points characters gain new
levels.\marginnote[-4em]{As gold turns into experience, the pursuit of
  treasure is a central element of adventures. Sometimes the simple
  act of bringing the loot back to safety can be a problem if you
  weakened and heavily loaded on your way back to town.}

\key{Level}: As time passes, characters hit better, get better saving
throws and gain hit points. They \emph{gain a level}.

\key{Hit Points}: Hit points indicate your endurance, luck and will to
live.\marginnote{Hit points are a measure of much of a beating a
  character can take.} As you \emph{gain} a level, roll as many dice
as you have levels and keep the result if it is is \emph{higher} than
your current hit point total. Fighters and dwarves use a d8,
magic-users and thieves use a d4, everybody else uses a d6. Do not
forget to add your constitution bonus to every die rolled. If your
constitution bonus is negative, you'll still get at least 1 hit point
for every die. If you \emph{loose} a level, roll as many dice as you
have levels and keep the result if it is \emph{lower} than your
current hit point total.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{Lucchesischer-Schaller.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

\key{Saving Throw}: Targets of spells and miracles are sometimes
granted a saving throw in order to avoid negative effects or to reduce
damage taken by half. The spell descriptions will explicity mention
any saving throws granted. Saving throws depend on your level. To make
it, roll a d20 and add your wisdom bonus. You must get number
indicated or higher.

\key{Circle}: As casters gain levels, they get access to higher spell
circles -- more powerful spells and miracles:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lcccccccccc}
Level  & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
Circle & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 &  5 \\
\end{tabular}

\marginnote{\key{Reaction Bonus}: This bonus is a bit smaller than the
  charisma bonus because the \emph{reaction roll} uses 2d6 instead of a d20:

  \medskip
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    Charisma & Bonus \\
    3 & -2 \\
    4--8 & -1 \\
    9--12 &  \\
    13--17 & +1 \\
    18 & +2
  \end{tabular}

  \medskip
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2d6 & Reaction \\
    2–5 & negative \\
    6–8 & neutral \\
    9–12 & positive \\
  \end{tabular}}

\medskip\key{Reaction Roll}: The referee will make a reaction roll for
almost all creatures characters talk to. Roll 2d6 and add the
\emph{reaction bonus} of the person doing the talking. The result
varies from immediate attack (2) to very helpful (12).

\key{Morale}: When the opposing side looses a member and when it has
lost half of its members, the referee should make a morale check. If
2d6 \emph{exceed} the morale score, morale breaks and opponents flee.
Opponents must make at most two morale checks. Player characters must
never check morale. Mercenaries hired by characters must make morale
checks when suffering losses. Retainers need not check morale when
suffering losses.

\clearpage



\key{Retainers}: Unlike mercenaries, retainers are loyal. Their number
is limited, however: 4 + charisma bonus (1--7). After disastrous
adventures, they'll need to make a \hyperref{key:Morale}{Morale
  Check}. Their morale is determined by the player character: 7 +
charisma bonus (4--10). If they roll higher than their morale, these
retainers will retire. \marginnote[-3em]{\hyperref[sec:wages]{Wages}
  must be paid at the end of the session.}

\key[Experience Points!Defeating Opponents]{Experience Points for
  Opponents Defeated}: These will be distributed amonst all the player
characters and their retainers. Retainers with no levels reaching 100
experience points will \hyperref[sec:charactercreation]{gain their
  first level} and from now on they will demand \emph{half a share} of
all treasures gained. Don't forget to determine their attributes and
hit points. Their hit points may not fall below their current value.
Humans may pick a class.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=4cm]{Beckenhaube.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Retainers gain experience points like a player character. Money from
wages and treasure shares can be turned into experience points. Gold
(and thus xp) can be passed to other characters as long as the
recipient's level is \emph{lower}.\index{Gold!Retainers} Retainers
will spend their money as quickly as possible.



\section{\index{Skills}Skills}
\label{sec:skills}

\marginnote{In most cases, no dice need to be rolled. If there is a
  secret lever behind the statue and the player said their character
  was looking behind the statue, then said lever will be found. We
  usuall roll dice when there's some risk involved. When rolling to
  force doors, the referee will usually roll for a random encounter at
  the same time.}

  locks, disarming traps, finding secret doors, moving silently,
  hiding, hearing, and so on.}

\section{\index{Combat}Combat}
\label{sec:combat}

\key{Surprise}: Both sides roll a d6. Your side is surprised if you
roll a 1 or a 2. If you're surprised, you'll have to skip the first
round. If the \index{Distance}distance between the two sides isn't
obvious, add the two dice and multiply the sum with \unit[10]{ft}. The
result is a distance of 20--\emph{\unit[120]{ft}}.
\marginnote[-4em]{Your \hyperref[sec:movement]{movement rate}
  determines whether surprised opponents can be attacked in the first
  round.}

\key{Initiative}: At the beginning of every round, both sides roll a
d6. The higer number begins. On a tie, players begin.
\marginnote[-1em]{The worst that can happen is that opponents go twice
  in a row.}

\key{Round}: Every round, you can move your movement rate and still do
something before or after your move. Typical \index{Action}actions:
melee or ranged attack, casting a spell or a miracle, read a
\index{Scroll}scroll, quaff a \index{Potion}potion. \index{Getting
  Up}Getting up also counts as a move. Dropping items you're holding,
drawing a weapon or saying things are free.\marginnote[-3em]{Anything
  may be \emph{attempted}, but chances of success and the time it
  takes will be determined at the table based on circumstances.}

\key{To Hit}: Roll a twenty-sided die (d20) and see if you hit. Add
your strength bonus when making a \index{Melee Attack}melee attack.
Add your dexterity bonus when making a \index{Ranged Attack}ranged
attack. Don't forget to add any magic bonuses, if you have a magic
weapon!\marginnote{The description of your class comes with a table
  where you'll see what you need to roll, depending on your level and
  the opponent's armor class. Roll that number or higher.}

\key[20 when attacking]{20}: If you roll a 20, you score a critical
hit which always hit and does max damage.

\key[30-sided die]{30}: Every player may use the thirty-sided die
(d30) in place of a d20 once per session. When rolling to hit, every
roll of twenty and above is a critical hit.

\key{Damage}: If you hit, roll damage using 1d6.\marginnote{We don't
  use variable weapon damage. All weapons do 1d6 damage.} Add your
strength bonus when making a melee attack. There is no bonus for
ranged attacks.

\key{Shield}: When carrying a shield\marginnote{At low levels, shields
  are crucial! Unfortunately, thieves and magic users may not carry
  shields.} and hit by a melee weapon or a magical force such as a
lightning bolt or a fire ball, you may sacrifice the shield such that
it absorbs all damage and is destroyed.

\key{Space}: In a wide corridor (\unit[10]{ft}) three people can fight
side by side. The space required depends on the weapons used, however:

\begin{marginfigure}[0.5cm]
\includegraphics{Eisenkappe.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Weapon Characteristic & Space Required & For \unit[10]{ft}\\
can be used in dense formations & \unit[2½]{ft} & 4 people \\
normal weapons & \unit[3$1/3$]{ft} & 3 people \\
requires space to swing & \unit[5]{ft} & 2 people \\
requires a lot of space & \unit[10]{ft} & 1 person \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Protection}: When you are attacked, nearby friends can protect
you by placing themselves in the line of attack. The attacker will
roll to hit your friend instead of you.\marginnote{Intelligent
  monsters can do the same thing and protect each other. Pets cannot
  place themselves in the line of an attack.} Every person can place
themselves in the line of at most \emph{one} extra attack per round.

\key{Retreat}: When retreating using your movement rate, your
opponents can follow you and continue to attack unless somebody is
covering your retreat. If you need to move faster, you'll have to
flee.

\key{Flee}: When running away, you'll have to survive one last round
of attacks. All your opponents in melee get one free attack with a +2
bonus.\marginnote[-4em]{Everybody in melee gets exactly \emph{one}
  extra attack against fleeing opponents. If you didn't use a melee
  weapon, you're not in melee and don't get to make an extra attack.}

\newpage

\key{Chase}: If you're being chased, roll 2d6.\marginnote{Optional
  modifiers: +1 for each of the following: if there are twice as many
  chasing you, if you have a faster \hyperref[key:Movement
    Rate]{movement rate}, if there’s a thief in your party, if it
  rains, if it’s dark. -1 for each of the following: if there’s an elf
  or a ranger tracking you, if there are wounded party members with
  you, if there’s snow on the ground.

  Only use the modifiers if you remember.} On a 2, you’re surprised.
On a 3–6, it’s a fight. On a 7–9, choose two points from the list. On
a 10–11 choose one point. One a 12, you made it, no problem.

\begin{itemize}
\item you were separated
\item it takes a long time
\item you got lost
\item you had to drop shields and backpacks
\end{itemize}

\key[Injury]{Injury and Death}: Hit points are a measure of much of a
beating a character can take. Once it falls to \index{Hit
  Points!zero}zero, and whenever you're hit thereafter, you'll have to
roll on the table of \emph{Death \& Dismemberment}.

\marginnote[1cm]{\key{Resurrection} is a miracle of the 7\th circle
  and requires a level~13 cleric. So long as some small portion of the
  body still exists and you haven't been dead for more more than a
  hundred years, you can be raised from the dead, fully healed.

  \key{Regeneration} is also a miracle of the 7\th circle and requires
  a level~13 cleric. This miracle will regrow missing limbs and mend
  broken bones. It's less taxing on the cleric than
  \emph{Resurrection}.

  \key{Raise Dead} is a miracle of the 5\th circle and requires a
  level~9 cleric. This miracle will not regrow missing limbs or broken
  bones. It simply restores you to life if you died due to hit point
  loss.

  \key{Cure Serious Wounds} is a miracle of the 4\th circle and
  requires a level~7 cleric.

  The Death \& Dismemberment table was adapted from a
  \href{http://trollsmyth.blogspot.ch/2008/06/playing-with-death-and-dismemberment.html}{blog
    post} by Brian Murphy.

% Note: \key doesn't produce labels inside table or tabular!
\label{key:death}
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{cp{9.1cm}}
2W6 & Result \\

2 & \key[Death]{Instant Death}: Decapitated or other grievous wound \\

3 & \key[Wound]{Fatal Wound}: gutted, stabbed through lung, broken
back; you'll die in 1d6 rounds \\

4 & \key[Amputation]{Severed Limb}: roll a d4: 1 -- sword arm, 2 --
shield arm, 3, 4 -- leg; you'll die in 3d6 rounds unless you cauterize
the wound using fire, stop the bleeding using a tourniquet or work the
miracle \emph{Cure Serious Wounds} \\

5 & \key{Broken Bones}: roll a d4: 1 -- sword arm, 2 -- shield arm, 3
-- leg, 4 -- rib; healing takes 2d4+9 weeks \\

6 & \textbf{Painful Loss}: roll a d6: 1 -- nose, 2 -- eye, 3 -- ear, 4
-- finger, 5 -- d6 teeth, 6 -- mean cut and ugly scar \\

7, 8 & \key{Unconscious}: knocked out and helpless for 2d6 rounds
unless wearing a helmet; with a helmet, stunned for a round \\

9 & \textbf{Stunned}: unable to act for a round; with a helmet, only
knocked down \\

10 & \key{Knocked Down}: knocked down \\

11 & no effect: you suffer no additional harm \\

12 & \key{Adrenalin Surge}: you get 1d4 hit points for every two
levels you have (round up); after the fight you'll collapse with zero
hit points and faint for 2d6 rounds \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\bigskip

\key{Conditions}: The \emph{Death \& Dismemberment} table imposes
various conditions:

\textbf{Arm Lost or Broken}: You can retrain your sword hand, no
problem. You'll need a hand to cast spells.\marginnote{ If you loose
  both arms, you'll need to get yourself a new arm. A mechanical arm
  made by gnomes will do, if you'll trust them not to pull a prank on
  you.}

\textbf{Leg Lost or Broken}: You can't walk until you get yourself a
wooden leg. You'll never run using a wooden leg.\marginnote{If you
  loose both legs, you'll need to find somebody to carry you or
  magical means of movement.}

\textbf{Rib Broken}: No sudden moves with a broken rib or you'll
pierce your lung!

\key{Helpless}: you can be killed without requiring a roll to hit.

\key{Stunned}: you cannot move and you cannot attack, but opponents
must still roll to hit.

\key{Knocked Down}: opponents get +4 to hit you until you get up;
getting up prevents you from moving in the same round.

\newpage



\section{\index{Movement}Movement}
\label{sec:movement}

\key{Movement Rate}: Humans have a movement rate (\key{MV}) of 12 --
that's \unit[120]{ft} per round (\unit[10]{s}) when \emph{running} or
\emph{fighting}. \marginnote[-1em]{Typical movement rates of other
  creatures: dwarf 6, halfling 9, elf 12, giant weasel 15, dog or wolf
  18, panther 21, galloping horse 24, flying hippogryph 36, flying
  pegasus 48.}

Proceeding slowly and methodically in the underworld slows you down
dramatically. MV~12 is only \unit[120]{ft} per turn (\unit[10]{min}).
That's the only way to have a fair chance of drawing maps and avoiding
traps.

\key{Carrying Capacity}: You can carry as many significant items as
your \emph{strength}.\marginnote{Typical items: armor, a weapon, a
  book, a potion, a torch, a quiver, a scroll. There's no difference
  between light and heavy items. Clothing, bags or backpacks don't
  count.} If you carry more, each extra item adds -1 to hit and to
saving throws.

\key{Stuff}: It takes a lot of small things to count as an item: a
hundred gold coins, gems, rings, amulets and the like count as a
single item.

\section{Reputation}
\label{sec:reputation}

\key{Reputation}: Fame and honor can be earned everywhere. Even the
\index{Gods!Reputation}gods are interested in the deeds of mortals.
Reputation is tracked separately for all the gods, towns and
factions.\marginnote{The referee maintains a list of gods, towns and
  factions and the respective reputation for each character.} The
higher your reputation, the harder it is to increase it. In order to
gain reputation, roll higher than your current reputation. The
starting reputation is 0. Thus, the first time reputation increases,
no roll is required.Reputation can be good or bad. The gods take an
interest in blasphemers, too!\marginnote{The higher your reputation,
  the harder it will be to increase.} Usually, reputation will not
change for more than ±1 per session.

\begin{marginfigure}[1cm]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=4cm]{Seusenhofer.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Roll an appropriate die depending on the deeds you have done:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{cp{9.8cm}}
  Roll & Deeds \\
  
  d4 & Finding and returning or stealing and destroying items of
  religious significance; saving or sacrificing animals; dedicating or
  desecrating altars and shrines \\

  d6 & Saving or sacrificing humans, dedicating or desecrating temples
  \\

  d8 & rescuing or sacrifice villages and whole communities, found
  cults or eradicate heresies \\

  d10 & convert, save or sacrifice nations and entire tribes \\

  d12 & render a service to the gods \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\key{Help}: The help of towns and factions may depend on your
reputation. Roll 2d6 and compare it to your reputation. If you rolled
\emph{higher}, help is not forthcoming.

\key[Intervention]{Intervention}: In an emergency, reputation also
acts as the percentage chance for divine intervention.\marginnote{A
  divine intervention could mean the appearance of an angel, a devil,
  demon, a naga, or the like.}

\key[Miracles!Reputation]{Miracles}: Reputation also limits the circle
of miracles available to clerics. Thus, a cleric cannot work any
miracles on their first adventure since they are lacking an
appropriate reputation. You need to gain a reputation of 1 in order to
work miracles of the first circle.

\section{\index{Spells}Spells of Magic Users and Elves}
\label{sec:spells}

Magic users and elves begin their career with exactly \emph{one} spell
in their spell book. When you gain a level, you can learn one or more
new spells from your peers. The referee will have at least one source
of new spells prepared.\marginnote{Magic users and elves will often
  stay close to their former master and keep learning new spells from
  them, often in exchange for services rendered. This is why many low
  level casters will simply have a subset of their master's spell
  book.
  
  An alternative to that is \key{Research}. This requires a starting
  point such as an existing a scroll, spell book or magic item, and a
  library of further books about the origins of magic, related spells,
  history and lore, and so on. The magic user or elf must have
  attained level~9 and spend 1,000 gold and two weeks per spell level
  researching (no adventuring).

  \bigskip The table determines both the number of spells you can cast
  \emph{per day} and the number of spells \emph{in your repertoire}.}

\key[Repertoire!Magic Users and Elves]{Repertoire}: The list of spells
in your spell book make up your repertoire. When casting a spell,
choose a spell from your repertoire. The size of your repertoire is
determined by your level:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
Level & 1\st circle & 2\nd circle & 3\rd circle & 4\th circle & 5\th circle \\
1 & 1 & - & - & - & - \\
2 & 2 & - & - & - & - \\
3 & 2 & 1 & - & - & - \\
4 & 2 & 2 & - & - & - \\
5 & 2 & 2 & 1 & - & - \\
6 & 2 & 2 & 2 & - & - \\
7 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & - \\
8 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & - \\
9 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
10 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 2 \\
\end{tabular}

\newthought{On 1\st level you start} with a single spell from your
master's spell book. Typically, \hyperref[sec:candidates]{retainers}
would have one of the following:

\textbf{Charm Person} turns \emph{one} humanoid creature into a loyal
friend. The target is granted a saving throw
vs.~spells.\marginnote{Undead and giants may be humanoid but they're
  still immune to this charm.} As time passes, more saving throws are
granted to the target:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{cl}
Intelligence & Timeframe \\
3--8 & monthly \\
9--12 & weekly \\
13--18 & daily \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\textbf{Detect Magic} makes all enchanted items, creatures and
locations within \emph{\unit[60]{ft}} shine with a pale blue light for
\emph{\unit[20]{min}}.\marginnote[-1em]{The pale blue light is visible
  to all.}

\textbf{Light} enchants one object within \emph{\unit[120]{ft}} for
\emph{\unit[1]{h} + \unit[10]{min/level}} so that it shines faint
light with a \emph{\unit[15]{ft}} radius.\marginnote[-2em]{If you target the
  eyes of a creature, it will go blind for as long as the spell lasts.
  Blind creatures are at -4 to hit. Targets are granted a saving throw
  vs.~spells.}

\textbf{Magic Missile} hits any target within \emph{\unit[150]{ft}}
and causes 1W6+1 damage. At 5\th level, \emph{three} missiles can be
shot at the same time and they hit different targets.\marginnote{There
  is no saving throw!}

\textbf{Read Magic} allows you to decipher magical runes for
\emph{\unit[10]{min}}. This is how to read spell books, scrolls and
magical inscriptions.

\textbf{Sleep} puts \emph{2W8 hit dice} of creatures within
\emph{\unit[240]{ft}} to sleep for \emph{4W4 $\times$ \unit[10]{min}}.
This is a magical slumber. They need to be slapped in order to wake
them before the spell ends. No creature may have more than 4+1~hit
dice. Creatures with less hit dice are affected
first.\marginnote{There is no saving throw!}

\newpage



\section{\index{Miracles}Miracles}
\label{sec:miracle}

You can beg the gods for a \textbf{miracle} by raising your hands and
praying or singing. The following table shows how your miracle working
improves as you gain levels. You need no spell book. \marginnote{As
  you can see, miracles very similar to spells. The key difference is
  that a cleric's \key[Repertoire!Clerics]{repertoire} is determined
  by god they serve.}

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
Level & 1\st circle & 2\nd circle & 3\rd circle & 4\th circle & 5\th circle \\
1 & 1 & - & - & - & - \\
2 & 2 & - & - & - & - \\
3 & 2 & 1 & - & - & - \\
4 & 3 & 2 & - & - & - \\
5 & 3 & 2 & 1 & - & - \\
6 & 3 & 3 & 2 & - & - \\
7 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & - \\
8 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 2 & - \\
9 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
10 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 2 \\
\end{tabular}
\marginnote{Wenn du die \textbf{Götter verärgerst}, kann es sein, dass
  du weniger Wunder wirken kannst, als auf der Tabelle aufgeführt
  sind! \emph{Achte auf deine Träume und Visionen} und gelobe
  Besserung, um wieder zu der dir zustehenden Macht zu kommen.}

\medskip Dein \textbf{Ruf} bei den Göttern bestimmt auch den
höchsten Zirkel der Wunder, welche dir gewährt werden. Weil du das
Spiel mit einem Ruf von 0 beginnst, wirst du im ersten Abenteuer noch
\emph{kein} Wunder wirken können!

Die \textbf{Wunder ab dem 4. Zirkel} werden dir \emph{persönlich}
von einem Agenten deiner Götter gewährt -- einer Valkyre, einem Engel,
einem Teufel und so weiter.

Typische Wunder des 1. Zirkels wären beispielsweise:

\textbf{Böses entdecken} zeigt dem Kleriker während
\emph{\unit[1]{h}}, welche der sichtbaren Wesen im Umreis von
\emph{\unit[60]{ft}} ihm Übles wollen.\marginnote{Eine Falle ist
  beispielsweise kein Wesen und kann nichts Übles ``wollen''.}

\textbf{Hand auflegen} heilt 1W6+1 Schadenspunkte \emph{oder} hebt
Lähmung auf. Das Gegenteil davon ist \textbf{Schmerz} und verursacht
1W6+1 Schadenspunkte. In beiden Fällen muss das Ziel berührt werden
(was allerdings keinen Trefferwurf benötigt).

\textbf{Magie entdecken} lässt verzauberte Gegenstände, Kreaturen und
Orte innerhalb von \emph{\unit[60]{ft}} für \emph{\unit[20]{min}}
aufleuchten.\marginnote{Dieses Leuchten ist für alle sichtbar.}
