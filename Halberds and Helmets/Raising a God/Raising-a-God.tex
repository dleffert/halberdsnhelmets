\section{Introduction}

This is a mini-campaign for players in their mid levels, levels five to ten. Player characters start looking for a place to build their castles and tower, thieves look to expand their network of spies and thieves, clerics start meddling in the affairs of the gods.

Here are some of long term goals for your players:

\begin{itemize}
\item End the slave trade on Hinia Oot
\item Raise the dead god of light, Arden
\item Topple the reign of the grey elf witch Susrael
\item Prevent the rise of the demon lord Tsathoggua
\end{itemize}

\section{Gods}

There is a chance that the gods will send one of their agents to help if their name is called. In order to succeed, players need to keep track of \textbf{a score for each god} they care about. As characters do things to honor or spite the various gods, their score goes up. This could be about saving or killing their followers, building altars and temple in their name, defiling their altars or acting on visions sent by them. This score is the percent chance that the god will act when their name is called. Whether the agents appearing will in fact help the characters depends on their past actions. An evil demon lord like Set might still send a naga to help a paladin of Mitra, hoping to mess with them.

When paladins and clerics cast \textbf{spells of level four and higher}, the spell effect usually involves the appearance of such an agent, and an opportunity for some discourse.

\textbf{Freya} is the goddess of winter, of spring, of fertility, of grain, of war, of cats and boars, of magic. She leads the valkyries and collects half the slain in battle. These dine with her in Sessrúmnir, her hall in Asgard.

\textbf{Odin} is the god of wisdom, of magic and poetry, of war, of eagles and ravens, of runes, of wanderers. He wields a magic spear, he raises the dead, he rides an eight legged horse called Draupnir. The other half of the slain in battle dine with him in Valhalla, his hall in Asgard.

In times of need, both of them will send a \textbf{valkyrie} named \textit{War}, \textit{Mercy} \textit{Spear}, \textit{Cruel} or \textit{Fight}: HD 6 AC 2 1d8 \textit{sword+3} MV 18 ML 12 XP 820, flying, only harmed by magic or magic weapons. The swords of valkyries are bright swords of light. When swinging such a sword, the wielder is compelled to shout for blood and glory at the top of their voice. Also, when allies are fighting, the owner of such a sword is compelled to draw it and join this melee. When resisting such a compell for the third time, the sword looses its magic. The owner is considered unfit to wield it.

\textbf{Loki} is the god of lies, of deceit, of misdeeds, of excuses and explanations, of looking the other way, of tricksters, thieves and shape changers, a friend of giants, the innocently accused, the misunderstood and the innocent.

In times of need, he might send a nameless \textbf{shape changer}: HD 4 AC 5 1d12 MV 9 ML 10 XP 190, \textit{polymorph} at will, immune to \textit{sleep} and \textit{charms}. Clearly, mostly useful when in need of deception.

\textbf{Mitra} is the goddess of law, of fire, of bulls, of contracts, of bonds, the swearing of oaths, of honesty and truth, of loyalty and sacrifice for the community. 

In times of need, she might send a \textbf{minotaur} named \textit{Silence}, \textit{Calm}, \textit{Truth Teller} or \textit{Spirit Guide}: HD 6 AC 6 1d6/1d6 MV 12 ML 12 XP 820, \textit{mesmerize} any listeners at will (listeners must save vs. spells or stop hostilities speak nothing but the truth), immune to \textit{sleep} and \textit{charms}.

\textbf{Set} is the demon lord of snakes and crocodiles, of assassins, of revenge, of spies and diplomats, of poison makers, of death traps, of hypnotists and mind benders.

In times of need he will send a \textbf{naga} named \textit{Sweet Stab}, \textit{Revenge}, \textit{Crocodile Tears} or \textit{Coral Death}: HD 9 AC 7 1d8 \textit{poison} MV 6 ML 12 XP 2400, \textit{fireball} (7d6) 3/day, \textit{charm person} at will, only harmed by magic or magic weapons.

\textbf{Pazuzu} is the demon lord of pestilence, of miscarriage, of famine and disease, of crows and vultures, of temptation and betrayal.

In times of need he will send a \textbf{vulture demon} named \textit{Gangrene}, \textit{Pestilence}, \textit{Corpse Eater} or \textit{Baby Killer}: HD 8+1 AC 5 1d4/1d4/1d6/1d6/1d8 MV 18 ML 11 XP 2420, flying, only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
