# Raising a God

James V West posted the following challenge [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/115204864602515979212/posts/MQy8sxrhQ2b): "to create a 64 page saddle stitched book that fits with BX. A setting, for example."
This setting document is based on my *Fünf Winde* (Five Winds) campaign run using my [Halberds and Helmets](https://github.com/kensanata/halberdsnhelmets/raw/master/Halberds%20and%20Helmets/Halberds-and-Helmets.pdf) rules. The LaTeX class I used was developed by Peter Fröhlich and announced [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterFr%C3%B6hlich/posts/V8E9B79rNLi).
