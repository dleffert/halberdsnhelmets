These pictures are from the book 
[Handbuch der Waffenkunde: Das Waffenwesen in seiner historischen Entwicklung vom Beginn des Mittelalters bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts](http://www.archive.org/details/handbuchderwaff00collgoog)
by Wendelin Boeheim (1890).

As far as I can tell, these images are no longer protected by
copyright. They are in the public domain. I have extracted these
images from the source files and uploaded them to an independent
